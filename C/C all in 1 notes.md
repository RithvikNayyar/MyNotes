## Basic of computing

Computer is a device which compute data.

Data can be:
1) Binary Data (0,1)  - Digital computer 
2) Physical phenomena (like speed, temp, pressure)  - Analog Computer
* Another type is hybrid computer which is Digital + Analog computer

#### Digital Computer
* Digital computer is a electronic machine which accept data in input, process it & produce information in output.
* They work on Bit()
* Input data is first converted to binary data then the output is given.(Text, video, image, audio)
* Advantages:
1) Accuracy
2) speed
* Disadvantages: Cannot calculate physical phenomena

#### Analog Computer
* They work on physical phenomena - Advantage
* They are less accurate & slow - Disadvantage
Ex: Speedometer, Voltage meter, Pressure gauge, etc. 

#### Hybrid computer
* It has some portion of digital computer & Analog Computer (ex: Digital speedometer, Digital thermometer, Electric multimeter)

* Note: The Above pictures shows the types of devices, Ac - Dc current & How computer reads binary number in system.

##### How does a Digital computer work
* In a digital computer lot of calculations goes on In ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) which performs all the work.
1) Arithmetical Operations : ( +, -, * , / )
2) Logical Calculations : (< , > , == , AND, OR )
* Arithmetic Logic Unit get all the commands from Control unit (CU) & performs all the task
* When they are combined together they are called CPU (Central Processing Unit)
* CPU takes data from input/output devices, storage devices(Hard disk drive)(Music, video) 
* CPU doesn't have direct link to HDD, if it were then as soon as it reads the data then it would run it without permission or directly open all files as soon as reads HDD.
* To over-come this issue there is a temporary Memory called RAM, So first the data is sent to ram then it runs on the system.

#### Software & It's Development
* Software either control hardware or do some specific task
* Software is a set of instructions written in specific computer understandable form to perform specific task.
* EX: When you are on a desktop and type something like your name but nothing happens and then you open a notepad and type your name then you see your name on the notepad. So this show that I/O devices are controlled through software.

##### How to develop a software
* For developing a software you need to know a programming language (c, c++, java, python)
* We need a translator for the language like compiler which changes our code to binary language so that out system understands.

#### Computer programming languages
##### Computer Language
* Language which is understand by the computer is called computer language or it is called Machine language(ML).
* Computer can only understand 0 or 1, so it means machine language only has two digits 0 or 1.
* We cannot write in Machine language as it is Complicated and Binary number vary computer to computer.
##### Programming Language
* Language in which we can design software/program for computer is called Programming Language (PL).
* Programming Language provide us with set of instructions to computer to execute. Set of instructions is called Software Program.
* The process of writing program is called Programming.
* The person who develops the software called software developer.
